    "name": "Robert Balbin",
    "description": "Robert is a southside local born and raised in San Jose, California. He spent many years wanting to be a dancer on any rap videos on MTV, but his body type, other desires, and his parent's encouragement to find his strengths led him to become a tax preparer. \n\nAll kidding aside, Robert enjoys working to help others. When Robert is not with tax clients, he enjoys spending time with his sister (his business partner) and family. \n\nWhether it be working in income taxes or his other passion for physical development, Robert enjoys seeing others progress and change.

    "name": "Leah Upson",
    "description": "Leah has been working within the tax business since 2012, and she was most likely the voice you heard when calling to make appointments. She has done everything from fixing the printer, picking calamansi for clients to take home, and ordering DoorDash for the appointments that lasted late into the night. She grew attached to the families and familiar faces she saw year after year, and as a result, decided to pursue her tax preparation credentials.\n\nHer formal degree is in Education, and her biggest joy when it comes to the job is being able to demystify income taxes by explaining it in a way that actually makes sense to everyone. Outside of income taxes, which may be hard for some of you to imagine, she enjoys gardening and PC gaming.",

    "name": "Bert",
    "description": "Bert is a seasoned office dog. He says hi when you come in, goes to his bed, and then proceeds to sleep the whole appointment. His favorite part about being the official mascot of Balbin & Upson is definitely the love and admiration his title deserves. \n\nOutside of working hours, he enjoys sleeping in other areas.",
